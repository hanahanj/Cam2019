I use the animal figure to explore empathy and sentiency, and to challenge the perceived order and comfortable classifications of life. My figures are tricksters—both familiar and alien, corporeal and ethereal—existing at the interface of human and animal worlds. Their stoic postures and ornate, often beautiful appearances can act as facades for existential uncertainties. They oblige our instinctual reactions, yet as we begin to identify with them, we admit that their identities are perhaps not so clearly defined.<br> 
Material and process are the tangible means through which I contemplate the realm of these figures. As I build large body parts, establish gestures, and articulate fine details, each figure acquires a unique physical and emotional presence. They are subtle hybrids, inspired by the nuance and sameness of species' behaviors and anatomies. In a process similar to taxidermy, the fired animal is often covered in a 'skin.' Rather than animal hides, the skins I create are made of unfamiliar materials, like string, sticks, nails, or sequins. They are meticulously and lovingly applied, allowing me to control and understand the emerging figure. <br>  
My practice is an empathetic gesture; the desire to create a believable sense of life pulls me forward as a maker.
