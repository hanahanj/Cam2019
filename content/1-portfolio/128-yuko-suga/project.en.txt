My experiences working with diverse groups of individuals contribute to an ever-expanding source of inspiration and modalities of creative expression. My work is a reflection of the relationships between line, form, function, and process and is often inspired by events and experiences in the community and environment. By taking a single idea and bringing together related concepts and adding layers to it before de-constructing them into simple, minimalist terms, it allows the viewer (or in the case of jewelry, the wearer) to develop his or her own relationship with and meaning in the work.
