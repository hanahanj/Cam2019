My work is an exploration of identity through our physical spaces and what we put in them. Common symbols and objects are used as the constant variables of our personal and public environments. Traditional textiles, color, religious symbols, and glorified objects serve as a vehicle to examine our cultural and physical landscapes. Altering these cultural symbols is a way of questioning the attitudes, fears, and dark truths that are hidden behind the objects we choose to surround ourselves with. <br>
My process provides an avenue to face these tensions in a literal way. Creating multiple works at the same time and in different aesthetic styles forces a conversation between the works that reveals more questions. As I paint structured forms and patterns, the waste and leftover material from those structured forms is used to create other paintings that reveal the unwanted realities that the original forms try to hide. The contentious space between these two languages is the standpoint from which the viewer experiences the work. In this realm lies the questions of the reality we create for ourselves and at what cost.
