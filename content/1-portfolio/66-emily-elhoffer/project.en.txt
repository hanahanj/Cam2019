++++

My work is a reaction to a body dysmorphia. Confronting the viewer on their own terms, I use the body's language, its parts, to provoke and question psychosomatic situations. Through texture and evocative materials like latex and elastic, my sculptures often exist in an expansive or contractive state. Its materials are often in flux, and the viewer is faced with a sense of another "entity" that is strange but familiar.
