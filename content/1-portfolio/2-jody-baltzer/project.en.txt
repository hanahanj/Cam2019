Eclectic Forms is the name of my studio because I work in a variety of media. I have been inspired by life in my hometown of St. Louis, the American desert Southwest, and Europe. I create jewelry, sculpture, and mixed media art. My work contains gemstones, crystals, precious metals, paper, wire, fabric, paint, acrylic, stone, asphalt, concrete, and plants. When possible, I use recycled and upcycled materials. I love to explore and express the possibilities of texture and form in eclectic ways. My art has been featured in galleries, public institutions, nationally juried exhibitions, and a museum permanent collection.
