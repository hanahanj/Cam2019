++++

I'm a mixed media jewelry and fine craft artist.<br> 
My goal is to create truly distinctive wearable art designs that lift the spirit and inspire the soul. Using a variety of materials such as copper, brass, sterling silver, along with my original drawings and paintings, is how I create my lines. Most of my focus is in nature and the female image. I use lighter weights in my materials so that my jewelry is comfortable to wear and are stunning creations.
