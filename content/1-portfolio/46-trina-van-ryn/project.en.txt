My work uses a lot of glitter, tinsel, and joyful symbols to explore my own experiences as a person getting to know herself within a broader cultural context. I've always been drawn to dichotomy, so my work often acknowledges beauty as an ideal to be lived up to while also being a tool fraught with unrealistic expectations. Within this exploration, I also touch on themes of power, humor, and the absurd.
