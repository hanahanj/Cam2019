My studio practice centers around drawing and painting on re-purposed substrates, pulling repeatedly from a small set of abstract forms in order to build fictional environments and narratives. I'm interested in treating found surfaces in the same way that I would treat a physical space when installing a site specific sculpture, which requires me to grapple with existing imperfections and limitations and a history that informs the work.
