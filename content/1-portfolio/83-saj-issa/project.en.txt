Growing up in the United States as a daughter of Palestinian immigrants, I am often situated between cultures looking from one side to another. Revisiting a homeland that faces an ongoing struggle for cultural and national identity allows me to forcibly question what the foundation of human civilization is. My works in primarily ceramics and mixed media allows me to re-interpret and investigate various forms that barriers manifest in.<br> 
Whether working in ceramics or with sculptural paintings, I repeat similar marks to make some kind of visual order. A few aspects on the surfaces make references towards certain symbols/signs found in public. Incorporating visual interruptions further communicates the notion of barriers. I hope to bring together the assorted elements and create unity amongst the line I draw around my thoughts.
