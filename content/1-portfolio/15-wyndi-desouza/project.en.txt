Borrowing from, as well as rejecting, the principals of data visualization, my work takes non-quantitative information and seeks to visualize it. Through the use of an artistic algorithm, I create systems for visualizing individual life, connection between two or more people, location, emotions, and the experience of trauma. The systems are translated into written rules and sent out into the world. The information received, whether a photograph or drawing is a collaboration with the community, locally and nationally, that illustrates geographical connections and social data.<br>
By utilizing photography, books, video, animation, and sound, I explore different means to present the data I collect. The work comes together in an archive and the information presented is a discovery of that data, as well as a compaction, rationalization, and translation of history and experience. My work utilizes the archive not only to examine the data, but also to complicate the viewer's idea of social data and the lived human experience.
