Using materials like collage, hot glue, paint, glitter, medical tape, lint, pastel, graphite and more, I construct works on paper, canvas and small sculptures that represent themes of feminine identity, familial love, bodily trauma and joy. These seemingly disparate issues and emotions come together in my often abstract, colorful and hopefully poignant work, in the same way they can uncomfortably come together in life.
