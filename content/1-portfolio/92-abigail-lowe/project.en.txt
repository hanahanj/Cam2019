My work begins with language. Storytelling is the medium through which I locate and practice empathy, so I build imagery and form from words. Some texts I encounter in books or poems, others come spilling from my own head; their transcription and translation has become the repetitive and patient core of my practice—I make small specific gestures again and again until they accumulate to a formidable volume. Whether I am drawing, tracing, cutting, or stitching, it is repetition that engraves time onto my work. It becomes visible in a garment overflowing with hand-drawn patterns, a paper silhouette made lace-like through cutting, handwriting layered to the point of illegibility. Transforming these hours and days of labor into ornate surfaces is how I depict the beauty and difficulty of understanding the world beyond myself.
