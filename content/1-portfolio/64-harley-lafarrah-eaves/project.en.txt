My work lies in the same bedroom as the psychedelic and camp aesthetic that promotes confusion while postulating equality. Along with it lie drug folklore, love, occult conspiracies, and cultural phenomena. It is as if the work were Fox Mulder, from the popular FOX network show The X-Files, as an angst-ridden teenager sitting in a bedroom filled with bong smoke, Christmas lights, psychedelic posters, succulent plants, with odd ceramic sculptures littering the window sill, who is trying to impress his partner Dana Scully by playing Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon while the M.G.M. production of The Wizard of Oz plays in the background.
