I create process-driven abstractions in oil. Inventiveness is the cornerstone of my practice, whereby every painting begins with a new method. The painting process is a balancing act between opposing states: fast and slow, beautiful and ugly, detailed and sweeping, considered and impulsive. I am especially invested in creating complex morphologies derived through improvisational strategies.<br>
I received my BA in Art from Grinnell College and my MFA in Visual Arts from Washington University in St. Louis. I currently live and work in St. Louis, MO.
