My name, Andrea "Kahrizma" Hughes. I live and create artwork in Old North St. Louis. The artist statement that I present is, "Born an artist, draw upon life!" The process of creating art is just as important, if not more important, than the end result of a finished product. As a self-taught artist, most of my skills were obtained through trial and error, multiple visits to museums and library books. Artistic influence on my work is by cultural travels to places like India and teachings from artist Kenneth Calvert who is the founder of the Zuka Arts Guild, of which I am currently President.
