++++

I am Kathy Gomric, one of three original founding artists still with the gallery. Surrealistic Fantasy in pencil is my passion! My work is done on BFK Rives and I love the impact the black, white and shades of gray make a bold statement on the surface. I have been drawing all my life. I also do commissions.
