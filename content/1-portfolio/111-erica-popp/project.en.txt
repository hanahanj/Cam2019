My newest work focuses on my experiences as a new mother and feels like a natural progression from work that I have been creating about my ancestors and the American dream. During the past year I have been striving to create work from the experience of motherhood, recognizing that women can be successful artists while also mothering. It is appropriate that I have also been settling into a new studio space, another version of nesting, where I have designed a space to create, and also space for my son to play and sleep.<br> 
My work is all process-driven and made by hand. Even my digital photographs turn into hand-printed artwork. I work primarily in hand-printed photographic media and in hand-thrown porcelain. My favorite processes are cyanotype, Van Dyke brown, and photopolymer intaglio printmaking. Each piece that I create takes hours to create. When I spend hours working in the studio I often think of the long hours my great-grandparents put in on their farm during the Great Depression, a testament of the immigrant work ethic that continues to inspire me.
