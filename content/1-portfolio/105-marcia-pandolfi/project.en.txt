In painting, drawing, and printmaking, I find a language that goes beyond any other. I use formal elements such as color, line, value, and composition, to communicate a mood or a sensory experience that is personal, and perhaps even recognizable. My first marks are intuitive, even random, and my planning is limited to a few materials, the size of the surface, and sometimes a color palette. However minimal those first few bits may be, they take me somewhere, and I then have the task of responding. At that point my focus sharpens, my decisions are more thoughtful and deliberate, and the work becomes a composition.
