**Brandon Bandy**
My work explores the "American image" as it has formed across a wide variety of times and sources. I began with photography, exploring familial relations, preserving memory, American tropes, and landscape in relation to lifestyle. Photographing my own family and surroundings over the course of 4 years, I have amassed hundreds of images displaying unremarkable and ordinary moments. My current work discusses the recycling and curation of images among digital natives and the formation of aesthetics by the amalgamation of subcultural identities and cherrypicked pieces of 1960-2000's culture.<br>
**Bridget Carey**
My current work explores personal memories and the objects contained in them. Memories have always been incredibly difficult for me to hold on to so physical objects act as anchors within them. Watermelon during childhood summers, magic 8 balls with questions about crushes, and swan planters that fascinated receive new life in my illustrations and prints. The desire to revive things long past, to fill a space with color, making hazy half remembered memories feel incredibly new again.<br>
Together we operate a risograph based printing and publishing operation which is a central part of both our practices.
