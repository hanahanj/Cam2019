Love is my religion and creating art is my prayer. I truly believe in the transformative power of art. Art has truly been a gift to my life and I feel compelled to use it to spread the gospel of Love. I am inspired by the immeasurable beauty of the world I see everyday. I choose to remain steadfast in my hope for humanity regardless of the daily news. Through my visual art, music, and healing arts practice I am able to share what I believe about the themes of personal peace, freedom, and Love.
