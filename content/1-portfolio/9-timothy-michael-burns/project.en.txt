From 2013 to 2016 my primary medium was photography. The subject was architecture including urban decay contrasted with new architecture, building construction, methods, and materials. Occasionally public space and domestic still life imagery entered the frame, exploring light, reflection, palette, materiality and architectural reference. The architecture coexists in nature and urban context without a human presence.<br>
My recent work has shifted to the medium of printmaking. These early monoprints translate elements of the photographic works into a more controlled, limited, abstract language. In these monoprints, I'm developing a new personal vocabulary while maintaining the primary focus on architecture, structure, and architectonics, generally devoid of the human interaction outside the artist's choices. In the most recent prints, color becomes a more active element
