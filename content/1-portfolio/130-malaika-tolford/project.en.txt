I make functional ceramic art decorated with unexpected design elements that come from the shapes we create when altering and creating places. For example, the organic and jagged forms that make up an urban coast line, the strange shape created by an array of airport terminals, or a series of twists and swirls culminating in a modern interstate exchange. They are the shapes of place. The morphology of our complex environments.<br> 
Before a tile on a wall or a cup in hand can be adorned with these motifs, it is mud in my hands, formed with the help of ancient technology. The physicality and semi permanence of ceramics is enticing in world increasingly dependent on digital and cloud based spaces. My medium allows me to explore the changing nature of place throughout history.
