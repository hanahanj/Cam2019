My work  in most cases has been about the journey in life. Trying to express the struggle, the beauty, the joy or the lacks thereof seems to be worthy subjects. In addition, I have loved doing gardens and children. But mainly, I have found the making of a painting  to be a wonderful way to look at life with eyes wide open. I hope to continue for a while longer to go on doing just that.
