++++

I examine the relationships between nature, contemporary culture and technology through work in related series using installation, drawing, digital media, printmaking, and painting. Currently, my series focuses on surveillance, natural disasters, and our experience of nature in this digital age. <br>
As a 2017 recipient of the Regional Arts Commission Artist Fellowship Grant, I learned 3D design and printing, resulting in a one-person exhibition of 100 surveillance drone sculptures at Gallery 210 at UMSL. <br>
My degrees are from the University of Missouri-Columbia (in drawing) and Washington University (MFA), along with post-graduate study in garden design at London University and electronic media at Webster University. I also publish reviews in Delicious Line, Art in America, All the Art, and temporaryartreview, among others. <br>
My art has been exhibited in galleries, museums and collections throughout the United States, in Berlin, and Beijing. Recently, I showed at Quadratfuß/NX2-Annex Art Berlin, The Arkansas Art Center Museum in Little Rock, the RAC gallery in St. Louis, The Mitchell Museum in Mt. Vernon, Illinois, and the Center of Creative Arts in St. Louis. In 2019, my one person exhibit The Space Between will be at The William and Florence Schmidt Art Center Museum, Illinois."
