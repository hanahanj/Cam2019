++++

I am Patrick L. Bellmann and one of the resident artists at the Soulard Art Gallery, I have been there several years and have displayed my photograhy of places, people and things that interest me hoping to share that interest with others. I am in a wheelchair and have a different perspective than most. I hope you come to enjoy my work.
