All I want is to feel comfortable in a space. The air is thick, I make a dumb joke, people laugh, I feel more comfortable. Other times I disengage and start looking out the window, or at my phone, or hide myself within my own clothing. I see this in my work too. I want to show you all the weird shit; everything that I don't quite understand. I want to show you the things that make me feel uncomfortable. I want to talk about the Catholic Church and its products. I want to talk about loss of innocence. I want to talk about the sexualization of innocence. I want to talk about porn and sex and nudity and why it makes me so anxious. But at the end of the day I still want to feel comfortable so I tell a little joke, or hide these things in plain sight so that the uncomfortable might just be a little more tolerable.
