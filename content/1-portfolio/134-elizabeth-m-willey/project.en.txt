History, folk tales, fairy tales, and mythology are the core inspirations for my current body of work, the "Folktale Series." I layer complex patterns from historical textiles, wallpaper, or embroidery, with iconic folktale or fairy tale images of creatures, objects, or botanical elements with an eye to formal design and story creation, mixing narratives both familiar and obscure.<br> 
Heat sealing each stratum with encaustic medium, comprised of luminous natural beeswax and damar resin, I employ collage, transfer, print-making, drawing, and painting techniques using graphite, ink, oil, and colored pencils, combining both contemporary and ancient media to create each piece.<br>  
The pieces are small in scale to encourage close examination of the intricate detail of each image. It is my hope that this intimacy will elicit contemplation of the implied narrative, while evoking the magical nature of the piece's subject, and of the artwork itself.<br>  
Elizabeth M. Willey is a Saint Louis artist and educator with an MFA in painting from Fontbonne University and a BFA in painting from Webster University.
