PWMD is a collaborative artist team composed of Marissa Dembkoski and Paal Williams. They received their BFA from Lesley University College of Art and Design in Photography and Art History in 2017. Their work intertwines artistic tensions from the history of photography, and contemporary modes of photographic production to question the constructs of visual culture.
