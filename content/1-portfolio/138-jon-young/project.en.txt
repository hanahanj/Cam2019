My work deals with the development of language, visual symbols, and signage. I appropriate symbols from various points in history: looking back to Paleolithic cave paintings and Greek pottery to contemplate visual language as well as pulling symbols from recent culture such as the line in the sand found in Western films and cartoons. Using the American West as a backdrop, I ground the position of these works in histories and mythologies of new frontiers. The work comes from my experience of continuous travel that came with being a child of a military family and reflects on the cultural displacement of my Native American identity. I use textiles, sand collected from significant places of a nomadic life, and the languages of the Arte Povera movement to create works that act as signs to become points of orientation in an ever shifting sense of place and time.
