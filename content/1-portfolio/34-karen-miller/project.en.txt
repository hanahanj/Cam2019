++++

I am one of 15 local artist at the co-op gallery - Soulard Art Gallery. My paintings are in rich colors with an atmosphere of peace, gentleness and beauty. I feel that we should be able to surround ourselves in beautiful art, in our home and office. Not just in museums and galleries. My work is primarily in pastels and oils.
