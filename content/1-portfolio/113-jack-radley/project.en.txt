The first memory I have of my father is peering over the kitchen table, hearing his frantic wrists shake the janky oak legs against the hardwood floors, as if they were about to collapse. Once I could stand on a chair and see what he was doing, I watched piles of silver dust accumulate on the table, like ashes from cigarette butts or cremated relatives. His evening routine of scratching lottery tickets: I remember the vibrant blues and pinks of words I could not read, but the allure of the $ success symbols, a visual language that predated my written ability to describe desires.<br> 
My work queers desire to explore the longings themselves—their origins, their manifestations, and their implications. I work across new media to confront viewers with the apparatuses that engender these yearnings, from video to the body. Humor underlies this effort.
