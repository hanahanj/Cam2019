Sequential art and illustration can transcend the pages and become like film; they call upon imagination. My work strives to tell stories in innovative ways that immerse the viewer and usually feature the human form as a strong narrative element. The figure is a universal communication of emotion, and even in my work that does not blatantly feature the body, it is echoed in the shape of the frame or the organic flow of a texture or design.<br>
I want to create images that not only submerge the viewer in the narrative, but are also centered on women and marginalized folks. Drawing off of Queer Theory, I aim to infiltrate spaces such as books and fiction, genres such as horror and adventure, mediums like sequential art, and rework the normative and heteronormative.<br>
I am interested in the strange and the unexpected, and using light, color, and alternative angles to layer a narrative. Working with different mediums, such as printmaking, papermaking, and bookbinding, I am able explore illustration in manners as strange as the subject.
