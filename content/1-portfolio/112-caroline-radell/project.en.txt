I have always had a sense of how my autism spectrum disorder instills in me a divergent understanding of everyday life. I have struggled with the adverse impacts that my disorder has on my ability to communicate, and found solace in painting's ability to express my emotions more precisely than I ever could. In the world of visual communication, my idiosyncrasies become inconsequential in my making process and my work's perception. <br> 
While abstract painting helps me transcend communication barriers, it also creates barriers of its own. My compositions are without a definitive focal point; the variety of paths the eye can take aims to visually relay my breadth of influences, associated with my autism spectrum disorder and otherwise. They can elicit discordant interpretations, even as the same viewer considers the same painting. <br> 
This element of my paintings evokes intrigue and warrants a closer, more focused look: a look that allows those interested in doing so to forge an individualized path through the colorful chaos of my energy. Creating this work has helped me let go of the desire to normalize my worldview, and, instead, use my unique perspective to try to expand the consciousness of others.
