My work is the product of a process of seeking the interwoven images of woman framed by a woman's gaze that is free from cultural misrepresentations. In my work, with my body as a primary medium, I continuously create disorder within forms, and it eventually creates female characters in the psychedelic woods that represents my constraints of searching for images of women as a woman. The characters expose, break, destroy, and undergo metamorphosis in the woods, creating repulsive images; yet, simultaneously, they adore, love, embrace, and liberate their own image. As the first viewer of my own work, I also find myself torn between disgust for and celebration of these images. I blur the line between the gender stereotypes that determine which female body image is acceptable and which is taboo, thus, finding my own interpretation of images of female potential.
