My images begin with a photograph. My practice is that of a traditional photographer working in film, vintage and antique cameras, chemistry and the darkness. Each image is a unique creation as it is made one at a time using traditional and historic methods. To insure the uniqueness of the image it is printed on decades old paper, which adds an element of unpredictability to the work. From this beginning the work may be augmented by additional media. My goal is to change the way a photograph is perceived and give the viewer alternatives to how they engage with the work.
