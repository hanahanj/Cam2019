To create is to be a part of the world around me.<br> 
When I begin a new piece I become lost in the stitches... It becomes a moving meditation, a way to explore ideas bigger than the world around me. It is my way to connect with others that requires no words. The work speaks to them. The pieces I design blend antique findings and objects from the natural world to create a talisman, an object imbued with a language all it's own. My hope is that the viewer will imagine a story for each piece and incorporate that story into their own lives.
