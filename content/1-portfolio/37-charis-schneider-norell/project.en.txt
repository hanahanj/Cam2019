My art practice consists of drawing with fibers within handcrafted frame looms. I position these drawings as three-dimensional drawing spaces, creating medium-scale installations. I call these works my ""fiber drawings,"" and see the drawing as the gestural residue of thought. While I use traditional weaving methods and materials as I work, I do not call myself a weaver. I see myself, first, as one who draws.<br>
My fiber drawings act as traces of my thoughts, memories, and gestures—all made visible through thread. Each pass with the fiber through the weft strings is my effort to grasp at something just beyond reach—as if I could affix those intimate moments into the spaces between the frames. In making these drawings, I seek to collapse the distance between childhood memories, places I long to recover, and where I am now in the present. While I acknowledge the futility of this task, my fiber drawings exist as my fragile attempts to pin down, to tie together, and to observe these longings into and within a physical, knotted form.
