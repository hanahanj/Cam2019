My principal mediums are drawing and painting - worked on over a variety of different surfaces. For subject matter, portraits are the predominant part of my work as I am fascinated and challenged by the wide-range of meanings they present to the viewer. These figures are rendered to be abstract and/or photorealistic, the style depends upon the focused theme. Overall, my work centers around the human figure, social commentary, and questioning moral character.
