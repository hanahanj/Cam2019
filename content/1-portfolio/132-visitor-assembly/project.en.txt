Visitor Assembly is a multidisciplinary studio cofounded by Alyssa Knowling and Marcus Stabenow. Composed of many moving parts, Visitor Assembly combines commercial and creative practices by means of design, photography, writing, installation, online platform building, and conceptual space creations. Visitor Assembly functions as a small business outwardly, but the intersections of the business and art worlds are heavily investigated by the studio. Marcus and Alyssa both maintain individual art practices and have showcased work in local and online spaces over the course of the past three years. They continue to explore the places in which their commercial and fine art practices overlap.
