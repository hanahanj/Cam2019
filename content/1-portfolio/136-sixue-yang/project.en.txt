I dream of monsters, rakshasas, demons, and genies. The bizarre moments in my nightmares, the glimpses of time where I did not talk, are of interest to me. I want to recreate this fanciful world through my paintings. Bizarre kaleidoscopes of strange sights and impressions are formed together with elements from movies, books, mythology, wall paintings, and Buddhist icons. I'm interested in the combination of figurative imagery and surrealist abstraction. I was initially influenced by classical Chinese mythology, Shan Hai Jing (Classic of Mountains and Seas). To draft the figures and structure the spaces, I began collecting sources from films such as Legend of the Demon Cat (2017), Spirited Away (2001), and Big Fish Begonia (2016). I am interested in a world of illusions primarily. In order to create the expression between real and unreal, I try to use different painting styles to merge visual spaces. I wish to make an enigmatic composition with the eccentric iconography of human characters, animals, and hybrids within familiar-looking but ultimately imaginary settings.
