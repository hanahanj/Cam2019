Do I indulge in being a "stereotype"? Maybe. But why should I conform to society that will never be accepting of my normal behavior. No matter what I'm gon be ghetto anyway so I might as well be myself. I'm learning to love myself and accept my culture through my art practice. Taking back "urban" and "ghetto" culture from appropriating vultures, who think our lives are a fashion trend. Because I use slang when I talk I'm not articulated enough to have conversations with my peers who look like me. The topic of conversations is the streets I breathe and lived on all my life. I'm Creating conversation about the attack on Black women. No one cares about our existence, but we gave birth to you. If it wasn't for us there would be no you. No matter how much in life I progress I will continue to be stereotyped for the life I choose live and socio-economic issues that surround me that I can't change. Instead of talking about how Beautiful it is to be Black, I'm talking about the reality of what it is to be Black for me. I am Black. I am a Woman. I am a Mother. I am Ghetto Trash.
