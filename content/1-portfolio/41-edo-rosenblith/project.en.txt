Hello <br>
If you come to my studio you will see....<br>
drawings
books 
t-shirts 
posters 
patches 
paintings
& 
prints <br> 
....all filtered through the lens of a personalized cartoon language. I utilize these mediums as a way to create images that address personal and historical narratives that are at are sometimes grotesque or sublime and will hopefully induce a reaction from the viewer, preferably laughter.
