I grew up in a small town in Iowa but spent the majority of my adult life in Peoria, Illinois. In 2008, after my husband retired, we moved to Swansea, Illinois to be closer to our grandchildren. I was not interested in art until my daughter and I took a Decorative Art (acrylics) class about 20 years ago. I enjoyed painting children's furniture and holiday decorations during that time. In 2010, I took my first art class with Jerry Miller and became very interested in pastels. I had my first framed pastel painting in 2013. In 2015, I began experimenting with abstract art using pastels. Over the last year, my love for animals inspired my paintings of custom dog and cat impressions using pastels. My friends and family have encouraged me on this journey. I am so excited to have my art at the Soulard Art Gallery. I am still learning and I love every minute of it!
