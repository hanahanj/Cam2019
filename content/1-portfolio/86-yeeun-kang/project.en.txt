My artwork demonstrates the relationship between the moments of resonance and the revisioning of memory. The sense of an "infinite instant" permeates the way I see the world. It is essential in my art for me to visualize the remembrance of longing emotions that are created by the recollection of places, people and memories.<br> 
My process involves a sense of freedom to access the creativity that takes place in my mind. Particular ideas and images re-occur in my work: island, air, and flow of light. They constantly seek a balance between abstract and representation. Transparent color and texture have become an essential presence, one that frees the scene from the literal or realistic. The layers of color combine to simultaneously evoke and revise memories.
