++++

I have been an active artist for over 45 years and have that exhibited my paintings in the U.S., Europe, Africa, the Caribbean and most recently in an Italian invitational show. In 2018, ART St.Louis included four of my paintings in their "Honors Show." I taught art in various venues in St. Louis and 9 years at the Art Institute of Seattle. I have a Masters of Fine Art degree from Northwestern University. The first floor of my address is the gallery "HORSLEY ARTS" and the second floor is my studio and living area. For Open Studios, I will have my work of oil paintings on display in both the gallery and the studio. I do show other local artists on occasion.
