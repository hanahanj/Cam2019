++++

Connecting and engaging with larger community into my studio practice as well as community engagement art projects are my greatest strengths. Active participation, passive integration and open-ended dialogue between myself, my works and my audience defines my practice as an artist for the past 8 years. Having travelled through most of India and my experience of working with underprivileged communities at St. Louis has helped evolve me as a person and as an artist.
