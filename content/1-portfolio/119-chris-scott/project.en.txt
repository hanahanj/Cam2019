My paintings are a navigation of studio clutter, determining materials via a resistance to dispose of the byproducts that come about through the painting process. There is potential for beauty in small things. An inch of fabric often sits for months in a container before finding a comfortable home. The design varies painting to painting, often being determined by an initial knee-jerk reaction to an existing gesture such as a tear or fold in canvas. I find myself spiritually invested in the abstract expressionist's belief of automatic painting, that if you "turn your mind off" and just paint, you will perhaps find a greater meaning. In that regard, I believe my paintings are a navigation of life clutter as well as studio clutter. A search for clarity and an inevitable arrival at ambiguity.
