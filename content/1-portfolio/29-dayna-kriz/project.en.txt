My current work is an exploration of my whiteness and its connection to historical and contemporary manifestations of systemic oppression. Through my current work I am experimenting with my cultural and material history as it intersects with critical race and cultural theory. <br>
In the studio I am touching Czech traditions and art forms I encountered in my youth through the creative life of my Grandmother whose work gave her and our family a deep connection to others. I experienced her passing at an early age, which in retrospect, highlighted our family's (already ongoing) assimilation into white American values and norms. In the absence of her creative inheritance in my life was a formal Fine Art college education, which trained me in the ways of Western-Colonial-European art making. This particular form of making—in all of its environmentally crude and socially isolated processes—run contrary to my concerns regarding the unfolding and interlinked social and environmental crises.<br>
In my previous work, these tensions propelled me towards co-creating neighborhood art spaces in Hyde Park, St. Louis for 4 years. From the closure of that shared work, and its rich and complex experiential gifts, is the seed of my current work.
