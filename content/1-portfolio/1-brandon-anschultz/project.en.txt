My work aesthetically explores the intersection of painting, collage, sculpture and installation around themes of queer identity. Currently, I am thinking about what it was like growing up as a gay kid during the height of the AIDS crisis and rising queer visibility. Fear, rage, joy and sadness. My experiences were personally mine, but not unique. My goal is to walk the line of not being overly sentimental or showcasing personal trauma. I am attempting in the work to dive into this tense juncture between pain and possibility, examining it through the lenses of personal memory, coded signals and the art and culture of the time. While the work is rigorously formal and can be "beautiful," it both highlights and camouflages the confusion around such intense ideas. I feel that it's my role as an artist to ask more questions than to propose answers.
