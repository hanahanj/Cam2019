I am an interdisciplinary artist whose work experiments with duration. I utilize material-specific processes to express a yearning for deep-time in the age of no-time. Employing mundane rituals, I construct artifacts that visualize duration, loosely coalescent aggregates in video, installation, performance and text.<br>
Interested in the ways relationships between self and others are evolving, as temporal experience is re-framed by digital technologies and publics are rearranged into networks. I work between the on and offline. My practice demarcates the studio as a site for transformation and transmission, production and performance, making space for happy and unhappy collisions.<br> 
I received my BFA in Painting from the Kansas City Art Institute and MFA in Art Theory & Practice from Northwestern University. I was born in Alexandria, VA and am currently based in Saint Louis, MO.
