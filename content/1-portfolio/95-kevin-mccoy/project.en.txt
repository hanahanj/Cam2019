Kevin McCoy, who is part of the duo named WORK/PLAY, utilizes serigraphs, publications, time-based work and installations to challenge comfort zones by addressing master narratives, representation, erasure and dual meanings. McCoy seeks to explore these topics in relationship to the constructed image. Image in itself is a loaded definition. Image can be representation, public perception, reputation or an icon. In a society driven by image and meanings, pervasive narratives definitely play a key role in shaping the collective consciousness. It is through research, materials, and form where complex histories and the deconstruction of historical images or stereotypes can be examined.
