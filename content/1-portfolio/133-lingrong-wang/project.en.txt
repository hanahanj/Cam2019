Urban residents subconsciously search for the sense of security both physically and mentally. While city government provides secure facilities for people, it cannot give them mental security. Where can we get the senses of security? How to define the senses of security?<br> 
Folding plays an essential role in my artwork. The repetitive act of folding is derived from my childhood memory. When I was walking back home from school, I would fold grass or paper to pass the time. Instead of folding Chinese items, I choose to fold The New Yorker magazines. The repetitive conduct is an attempt to gain a spiritual stability in a new environment: realizing the differences between western and eastern culture, and encountering the culture shock. Folding repetitively becomes a bridge to connect the east and the west or something fill the gap caused by the cultural difference, and in the meanwhile, it emphasizes my difficulties and struggles in trying to fit in.<br> 
Psychologist Steven J. Heine says: "humans are unique in the extent of their dependence on culture...human cultural learning is contrasted with that of other species." Different cultures mark boundaries, and such boundaries restrict people from fully understanding each other.
