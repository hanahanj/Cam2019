The St. Louis Artists' Guild is located in the iconic, mid-century modern Famous-Barr department store. We provide opportunities for juried, solo, and small group exhibitions that are always free and open to the public. Classes are offered to students of all ages and abilities. Members, students and instructors have opportunities to use the classroom during Open Studio hours. Instructors and artists who use the facilities are represented in the Open Studio Tour.
