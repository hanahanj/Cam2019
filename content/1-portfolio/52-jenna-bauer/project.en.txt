My practice includes painting, printmaking, drawing, teaching and producing arts education projects for the community. 
I've maintained studios in Hell’s Kitchen NYC, the Hudson River Valley, and in my hometown: Saint Louis. <br>
I believe: Life must be a form of art, and neither life nor art is ever at rest. 
Even in the greatest stillness there is a molecular hum that completes life. 
The arcs in my painting are embodiment of this fact.
