I am a design artist, painter and an installation artist. I have been a professional artist for nearly 40 years. I recently moved here from Mexico, but I have a studio in New York where we still have a home. My work is in collections in many parts of the world as well as the USA and Mexico. I have exhibited and in galleries in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, North Carolina, Hawaii's Oahu, Maui and Kauai islands as well as several places in the Riviera Maya in Mexico, France and Japan.
