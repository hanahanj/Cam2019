My current body of works explores human interaction and identity. I am specifically interested in investigating how our identities are formed through interactions with others. I frequently use fabric and other malleable materials to create illusions of actions that have been halted or frozen in time. This creates a dialogue between material and form that investigates the fragility of these moments that define us. I reflect on my personal experience with sexual assault and domestic violence to question the human capacity to act with both intended violence and compassion. This results in objects and installations that highlight dualities that exist within human nature and encourages the viewer to evaluate their own interactions.
