The ways in which humans manipulate objects and each other to survive is fascinating to me. I am motivated to create works that honor the perseverance of life.<br> 
My works have been focused on the perseverance of human life. Adapting, converging and transforming continually throughout our life cycle. The many personality traits and characteristics that we pick up along the way are what I attempt to highlight in my sculptural work. Focusing on one specific aspect at a time.<br>  
This year, I am also working on a new line of functional pottery. Designed for comfort, functionality, and versatile aesthetic.<br>  
Most pieces are wheel thrown with hand built attachments using a mid-fire stoneware clay. The majority of my surfaces are achieved with handmade glaze formulas.
