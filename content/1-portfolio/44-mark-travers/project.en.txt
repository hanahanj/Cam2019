In this series, my work has two influences: Architecture and Spirituality. There are references to architecture in each of the works shown but, as a painter, I find myself most interested in the translucence of light. I challenge myself to recreate that translucence through the layering of opaque paints. The combination of layering and translucence in my work creates a visual 'shift'—almost as if a doorway or window has opened to another dimension, much as you might experience when seeing light shining through clerestory windows in a Gothic cathedral.
