A daily self portrait project over the course of several years helped me to discover and develop my own personal self identity. This experience both behind the camera and in front of the lens gave me insight to understand, connect, and collaborate with the world around me. With the addition of sculpture and wearable art into my photographic practice, I began to explore the possibilities of an interactive image capture process. As a result, the camera has become not only a tool to create but also to engage. I hope to pursue the evolution of my self portraiture by expanding my focus from documenting an individual portrait to cultivating our experience of human-camera interaction.
