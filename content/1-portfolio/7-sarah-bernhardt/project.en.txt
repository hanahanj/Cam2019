My work explores the complex layers of community re-habitation through the lenses of history, architecture, movement, and body using photography, painting, and time-based media. I received my MFA from Washington University in St. Louis and am the director of Intersect Arts Center and Gallery, as well as a professor at the University of Missouri St. Louis and SLU.
