I am an artist and educator based out of St. Louis, MO. My practice involves an interest in constructed histories, cultural decorum, and the overlooked representations of race and masculinity. I received my MFA from Fontbonne University (2014), and serve as an adjunct faculty member at Washington University, Fontbonne University, and St. Louis Community College. In 2015 I completed a 11-month Arts and Education Residency at the Schmidt Art Center in Belleville, IL, and served as a summer artist-in-residence at Paul Artspace in 2017. I have been exhibiting in the area including a recent solo exhibition at The Millitzer (May 2018), and most recently "Plaid Progress" a group exhibition centered on overlooked histories, curated by Lyndon Barrios Jr. for the Intersect Arts Center (Summer 2018). I will be a featured artist for LVL3 Gallery in Chicago, and currently am scheduled to be included in Granite City Art and Design District's (G-CADD) December group exhibition and a solo exhibition in September 2019 at Reese Gallery.
