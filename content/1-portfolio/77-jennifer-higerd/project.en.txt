Process is a central element in my studio practice. The path that leads to a finished work is a twisting and branching path providing small detours. The materiality of the clay - the physical properties and behavior of clay - continues to inspire and delight me. <br>
Investigating many clay bodies, I find conceptual meaning in the materials themselves. One body of work comes from the clay and glazes that accumulate in the bottom of the ceramic studio's sink. In a similar way, what we are today is a result of all the experiences that gather in our memory.<br>
Likewise, the method of forming is rich in meaning for me, the maker, as well as the viewer. I have been returning again and again to the meditative act of throwing. Making these small, simple forms grounds me; my mind grows quiet and I relax. The repetitive act of throwing reminds me of my mom, who spent so many evenings crocheting or cross-stitching. Loop upon loop and stitch after stitch, the small pieces come together, forming a little community. The repetitive acts of forming the same shape, and of inscribing and inlaying marks on the surface feels like a mantra or prayer.
