My unique photo-based mixed media art is iconic visual vocabulary.<br>
My authentic style has led to exhibits, art collections and events which integrate history, education, and entertainment. I was raised in St. Louis in a family that collected typewriters. These machines and the vintage cameras are part of my personal history and led naturally to becoming part of the subject matter of my visual expression. I'm inspired by vintage Americana and also affected by pop art and digital technology. I have been successful in commercial graphics, publications and printing for over 20 years.<br> 
I currently live and work in the perfect intersection of St. Louis, where antique row meets the local progressive art culture, as well as Santa Monica where I have developed an unique art style in my Santa Monica Airport Hanger turned art studio.<br> 
My work has been featured in the documentary film, "The Typewriter in the 21st Century," the movie "Friends with Benefits," and TV shows including "Two and a Half Men," "Curb Your Enthusiasm," "The Mentalist," "Criminal Minds," "Reba," "Bernie Mac," and many more.
