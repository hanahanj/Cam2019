Transforming flat sheets of metal into dimensional forms incorporated with folds, surface texture, and pattern is a technical challenge I'm continually exploring. Inspiration works interchangeably with the traditional metalsmithing tools I use and range of applications they have to offer. The aesthetic components that result from merging traditional ornamentation with modern elements of pattern and surfaces treatments give my jewelry art distinctive character. Aged and conventional in appearance with features that simultaneously reflect a modern / industrial twist.
