There is an ethics to observational painting that has to do with owning without possessing, competing, or invading and allows for a meaningful exchange to occur. I am fascinated by the liminal space that exists between reality and my own synthesized response to that reality - by my desire to empathically identify with a thing through paint. My paintings are first and foremost a record of shared time been myself and an object and explore the decorative, materialistic, and often unfeeling still life genre as it relates to our turbulent political moment.
