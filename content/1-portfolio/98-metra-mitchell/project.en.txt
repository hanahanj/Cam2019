Each figurative oil painting is crafted with a desire to evoke empathy and emotional response from the audience. I explored the intimate conflict between content and form through various archetypes whose identity is based upon context. This collection of mediated bodies and gestures were arranged/rearranged making explicit both the framing and fragmentation of identity. I referred to this process as ""visual surgery"" which I described in three stages: confrontation, negotiation and collaboration. This process stimulates a cathartic experience where broader harmonies and complications are analyzed within the painted psychologically charged dramas. Casting these different archetypes seeks to create a unique and critical image.<br> 
Through physicality, play and projected imagery this new body of work investigates vulnerability/control, revealing/concealing patterns and the juncture between composure and discomposure. Within the theater of painting, bodies and the space physically became the playground. The texture of these paintings is achieved through the thick application and accumulation of slabs of paint, embedding the content into the painted illusion. In this way, the images should convey both conviction and ambiguity.
