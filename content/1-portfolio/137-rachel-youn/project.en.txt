My work collapses notions of authenticity and artifice. I utilize soft sculpture, faux materials and glossy veneers to poke fun at the superficiality of hierarchal narratives embedded in objects and lifestyle. Sourcing from discount home furnishing stores and oriental goods peddled on craigslist, my work identifies with surface-level replicas and cheap alternatives found amidst suburban detritus that sincerely attempt to simulate status and class. It is a meditation on the flux between cultures and genders, driven by my desires and failures to feel genuine.
