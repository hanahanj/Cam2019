I create one of a kind glass beads using a torch and incorporate them into jewelry which highlights the depth, transparency, and unique properties of the glass. My signature beads are blown hollow beads that are both lightweight and durable, and make for a unique statement piece when strung together. I also enjoy playing with reduction and striking glass which create mesmerizing metallic, luster, and opalescent effects. My work is inspired by nature, oceans, beaches, and the cosmos.
