The lens through which I make my art that has been ruled between a rigid dichotomy of my mother and father—the emotional and the impassive, the intimate and the reserved. Intimacy is the common denominator of my work, whether the objects were arranged as such, inherently built in, or coldly withdrawn. <br>
Most of my work deals with the interpersonal relationships we create and maintain with others, which means I have a tendency to work in multiples. I explore our desire to be vulnerable and non-sexually voyeuristic, particularly within the home. Visually and conceptually, the work falls somewhere on the spectrum of consciously ambiguous to the highly personalized.<br>
The objects range from representational figures to abstract bulbous forms to soft internal sculptures that feel familiar, yet are at the same time unrecognizable. I create forms that simultaneously feel sexual and asexual, humorous and sobering, comforting and grotesque. They are arranged, and perhaps later rearranged, to give a different and ever-shifting understanding of their dynamic dependent on the viewer's subjectivity. When I make I find I project myself, or others I know, onto the work. My goal is for the viewer to do the same.
