WORK/PLAY is an interdisciplinary design duo based in St. Louis, MO. Kevin received a BFA in Graphic Communication from the University of Missouri St. Louis and currently enrolled at the Sam Fox School at Washington University earning his MFA. Danielle is a conceptual artist, writer, and educator. Together, they combine illustration, minimal contemporary design along with experimental printmaking techniques into their art practice. With their use of design and printmaking, the collaborative duo has expanded their practice to textile arts, site-specific installation, publication and bookmaking to deliver an acerbic dose of revelation to inspire audiences and trigger experiences. They continuously experiment with new techniques, seeking to push beyond the perceived boundaries of art, design and printmaking.<br> 
WORK/PLAY has shown their work locally and nationally including SPRING/BREAK Art Show in New York, The Sheldon Galleries in St. Louis, Lillstreet Rooftop Gallery in Chicago, and O Cinema Wynwood in Miami. They attended residencies with Forest Park Forever, ACRE, and forthcoming Santa Fe Art Institute. They have sat on artist panels, given lectures and continue to teach, work as studio artists, and are involved in their local arts community.
