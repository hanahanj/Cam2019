I am currently a bit over three years deep in my pursuit of a BFA in studio art with a second major in philosophy. My practice is heavily driven by investigations of the self, the banality of existence, and the shared experiences of time; these explorations are often contained in the vessels of sculpture, photography, and time-based media. Often times, my work juxtaposes the common and expected with the unfamiliar and jarring, to serve as a method of re-contextualization. The evocation of the mundane acts to create a relationship of familiarity and comfort with the viewer, which then susceptible to being broken and reformed. An uncanny peculiarity may choose to present itself here, for this curated environment is simultaneously both so closely associated with the ordinary while simultaneously embodying a certain "off-ness".
