My photography practice is rooted as a way for me to explore, connect and understand communities. I take a walk or drive around and then stop to get out and explore, allowing a slower pace that encourages conversations with people and the time to contemplate and frame moments and scenes. I also love taking photographs from transportation. I like getting a glimpse of something almost lost in passing. In our fast paced world, there is a certain reality I like to capture from a possibly blurred, chance encounter I could have only spotted from the access a car or train provides.
