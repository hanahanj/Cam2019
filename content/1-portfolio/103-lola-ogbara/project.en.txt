As an interdisciplinary artist, I pride myself on bringing focus to the delicacy of the human form. I choose to explore sexuality and body forms, specifically of the bodies of people of color. In particular, the versatility of femininity within Black femme existence has streamlined my interest. Using clay as a material brings about a fragility that is needed in my ceramic sculpture. I celebrate vulnerability, often using my own body as a source of inspiration. I am most interested in social standards, body stereotypes, social observance, and education as it pertains to the body.
