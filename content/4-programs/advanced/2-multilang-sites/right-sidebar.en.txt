Title: Multilang Sites

----

Text:

Our Themes are ready to be translated. Only 3 steps are required.

## Configure your languages
First you need to tell kirby wich languages you will be using, this is done by editing the `/site/config/config.php` file.
English is pre-registered and set as a default language, so you just need to add your other languages as a simple associative array.

```
c::set('languages', array(
  array(
    'code'    => 'en',
    'name'    => 'EN',
    'default' => true,
    'locale'  => 'en_US',
    'url'     => '/',
  ),
  array(
    'code'    => 'fr',
    'name'    => 'FR',
    'locale'  => 'fr_FR',
    'url'     => '/fr',
  ),
  array(
    'code'    => 'de',
    'name'    => 'DE',
    'locale'  => 'de_de',
    'url'     => '/de',
  ),
));
```

## Translate Theme Variables
Navigate into the `/sites/languages` folder and duplitate the file `en.php` and name it with the specific language shortcode.
Repeat for each available languages and edit the new files with you translations.

## Translate you Content
You can now translate your content throught the Panel.

## Access your translations
Now that everything is translated you may want to let your visitor access your site in the language their prefer.
You have 2 choices:
- **Automatic Language Detection:** Kirby can detect the prefered language of the visitor. This has to be activated by adding this in you `/site/config/config.php`:
```
c::set('language.detect', true);
```

- **Let the visitors select their prefered language** by adding a language selector in the menu, this can be done in the (link: docs/getting-started text: Site Options) configuration page.

You can also combine these 2 solutions.
