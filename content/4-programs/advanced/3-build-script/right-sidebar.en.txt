Title: Build Script

----

Text:
Our theme come with a handy build script to allow developers to easily edit js/css files yet serve optimized files to the visitors.
We use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) as our build system and we includes everything you need to get you started.

## Install dependencies
First you need [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) installed on your system. Refer to their respective documentations for instructions on how to install.

Then you can install the dependencies needed by gulp by running:
```
npm install
```

## Gulp Tasks:
We includes a few Gulp tasks in the `Gulpfile.js`

- **styles:** minify and sourcemap `all.css` into `all.min.css`
- **scripts:** concatenate, minify and sourcemap js files
- **serve:** run a local php server and watch for changes. Handy while developing.
